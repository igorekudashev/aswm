-------------------------------------
“Slime” file format
2 bytes - magic = 0xB10B
1 byte (ubyte) - version, current = 0x09
1 byte (ubyte) - world version (see version list below)
2 bytes (short) - xPos of chunk lowest x & lowest z
2 bytes (short) - zPos
2 bytes (ushort) - width
2 bytes (ushort) - depth
[depends] - chunk bitmask
  -> each chunk is 1 bit: 0 if all air (missing), 1 if present
  -> chunks are ordered zx, meaning
  -> the last byte has unused bits on the right
  -> size is ceil((width*depth) / 8) bytes

4 bytes (int) - compressed chunks size
4 bytes (int) - uncompressed chunks size
  <array of chunks> (size determined from bitmask)
  compressed using zstd

4 bytes (int) - compressed tile entities size
4 bytes (int) - uncompressed tile entities size
  <array of tile entity nbt compounds>
    Same format as mc
    inside an nbt list named “tiles”, in a global compound, no gzip anywhere
    compressed using zstd

1 byte (boolean) - has entities
[if has entities]
  4 bytes (int) compressed entities size
  4 bytes (int) uncompressed entities size
  <array of entity nbt compounds>
    Same format as mc EXCEPT optional “CustomId”
    inside an nbt list named “entities”, in a global compound
    Compressed using zstd

4 bytes (int) - compressed “extra” size
4 bytes (int) - uncompressed “extra” size
[depends] - compound tag compressed using zstd

4 bytes (int) - compressed world maps size
4 bytes (int) - uncompressed world maps size
  <array of tile entity nbt compounds>
    Same format as mc, with a new "id" int tag
    inside an nbt list named “maps”, in a global compound, no gzip anywhere
    compressed using zstd
-------------------------------------

Custom chunk format
[if world mc version is 1.13 or newer]
  4 bytes (int) - heightmaps size
  <array of heightmap nbt compounds>
    same format as mc, uncompressed
    4 bytes (int) - biome array size
    <array of biomes (ints)>
[else]
  256 ints - heightmap
  256 bytes - biomes
2 bytes - sections bitmask (bottom to top)
  1 byte (boolean) - has block light
  [if has block light]
    2048 bytes - block light
  [if world mc version is 1.13 or newer]
    4 bytes (int) - block palette array size
    <array of block palette nbt compounds>
      same format as mc, without being inside a global compound
    4 bytes (int) - block state array size
    <array of block states (longs)>
  [else]
    4096 bytes - blocks
    2048 bytes - data
  1 byte (boolean) - has sky light
  [if has sky light]
    2048 bytes - sky light
  For each section
